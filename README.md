# React Zip Code Search Lab

In this lab you're given starter code to implement a Zip Code search app that uses an API. The final result should work like the application here: https://cunytechprep.github.io/lab-react-zip-search-solution/

- When a user types a valid zip code, the application will retrieve associated city information from an API.
- When the user types an invalid zip code the application should display `No results found`
- A complete solution will reduce unnecessary API calls

To implement this app, you're given access to a Zip Code API that you can access from your React app. [Below is a brief description of how the API works](#the-zip-and-city-search-api-documentation-ctp-zip-api).

## Mockups

Add an input field where the user can enter a zip code, like in the following image:

![Input field for searching Zip codes](zip-search-1.png)

Use the user input to [search the ctp-zip-api](#search-by-zip-code). If the zip code is valid the API will respond with an object for each city. Use that response to display each city in a separate div like in the following image:

![Display City Results](zip-search-2.png)

> NOTE: your styles (colors and look) don't have to be exact. Only functionality needs to be completed.
